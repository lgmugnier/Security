The original token construction was exceptionally weak.  We were able to take advantage of the 
length-extension properties of MD5 to create valid tokens without the user's knowledge. A far
more secure option would be to use a keyed hash function or HMAC.  If the key were the user's
password then in order to hash anything, one would need the user's password.  This is a much
more secure proposal because, supposing only the user and the server know the password, they are
the only two entities who can actually hash or check the hash of a value.  This way the adversary,
assuming they do not know the password, cannot forge a valid token.
We couldn't use our length extension attack because in order to set the initial state for the 
hash function, we would need to use the key or password.
